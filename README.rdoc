= LaunchTracks

LaunchTracks uses launchd and the Tracks Rack server to start your Ruby web
apps on demand.

== Install

  gem install launch_tracks

== Usage

To set up a Rack app:

  cd /path/to/myapp

  launch_tracks setup 4000

If there's a Gemfile in your app's base directory then LaunchTracks will run
your app with <tt>bundle exec</tt>. You'll have to edit your gemfile to add

  gem "launch_tracks"

then run

  bundle install

Your app will automatically start whenever you visit http://localhost:4000/ and
shutdown after 10 minutes idle.

The output from stdout and stderr will be available at /tmp/myapp-out.txt and
/tmp/myapp-err.txt respectively.

To restart your app <tt>touch restart.txt</tt> in your app's base directory.

=== Environment Variables

LaunchTracks will run your apps with the same environment variables as when it
was set up. In the following example, both VAR1 and VAR2 would be available to
the app.

  export VAR1=foo
  VAR2=bar launch_tracks setup 4000

=== Commands

[setup]   Creates a launchd plist for your app in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and
          loads it, making your app available for on-demand startup. Requires a
          port number for your app to run on as an argument.
          Example: <tt>launch_tracks setup 4000</tt>

[load]    Loads your app's launchd plist from ~/Library/LaunchAgents, making
          your app available for on-demand startup.

[unload]  Unloads your app's launchd plist from ~/Library/LaunchAgents,
          disabling on-demand startup.

[restart] Restart your app. The same can be achieved with
          <tt>touch restart.txt</tt> in your app's base directory.

[rm]      Unload and remove your app's plist from ~/Library/LaunchAgents,
          permanently disabling it.
